# Even Strings In Array

Write a function using ES6 syntax which takes an array of strings as an input argument and returns all strings where the sum of all ASCII characters within that string is an even number.

You can assume that the array only contains lower-case strings from the English alphabet.

Hint:
```js
  'a'.charCodeAt(0); // 97, not even
  'b'.charCodeAt(0); // 98, even
```
