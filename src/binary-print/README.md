# Binary Print

Write a recursive function `printBinary` that accepts an integer number of digits and prints all binary numbers that have exactly that many digits, in ascending order, one per line.

For example:
```js
printBinary(2) printBinary(3)

00             000
01             001
10             010
11             011
               100
               101
               110
               111
```
